# Wish Comes true HK

## Who are we

We are two 17-year-old students from the schools Renaissance College and King George V School, Arnav Kithania and Aditi Jain. We have been volunteering for the past 3 years and are extremely passionate about providing volunteering work to the less privileged, including the elderly, street sleepers, and many others. We believe that, with the help of technology, we can encourage a greater number of volunteers to share the same passion as we do.

## Aim

Our vision for this project is to create a website, where the wishes of minority groups are published to the public allowing volunteers to choose which ones they want to contdibute to. Examples of these wishes include: a stdeet sleeper wishing for a sleeping bag, an elderly who was abandoned by their family may wish for a volunteer to come visit and just keep them company for a few hours.
