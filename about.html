    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our vision for this project is to create a website, where the wishes of
      minority groups are published to the public allowing volunteers to choose
      which ones they want to contribute to. Examples of these wishes include
      volunteers helping children who wish for better grades by tutoring.
    </p>

          I was committed to creating WCT after meeting with Vishal, a minority
          student from the Gurukool Kids Foundation in New Delhi. Vishal didnâ€™t
          have access to basic educational necessities and all he could wish for
          was a pen and pencil. My vision for this project was to create a
          website, where the wishes of minorities like Vishal are published to
          the public allowing volunteers to fulfill their wishes and make their
          dreams come true. I really hope, working with you and multiple other
          NGOs we can truly make a difference in the community that we call
          home.
